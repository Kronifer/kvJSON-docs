Initializing your project
#########################

To initialize your project for use with kvJSON,
add this to the top of your project:

.. code-block:: python

   import kvJSON

   kvJSON.init(filename)

Make sure that you replace filename with an
actual filename. If the file does not exist,
don't Worry! kvJSON will create the file when
you run your project the first time.
